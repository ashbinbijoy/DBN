🚀 Enhancing Driver Activity Recognition with Deep Belief Networks (DBN)! 🚀
Understanding driver behavior is crucial for road safety and intelligent transportation systems. My latest project applies Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to accurately classify driver activities based on sensor data.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Unsupervised feature learning for improved activity classification
✅ Layer-wise pretraining to extract deep representations
✅ Fine-tuned with supervised learning for optimized performance
✅ Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

By leveraging DBN, we achieve a more structured representation of driver behaviors, improving the robustness of activity recognition models.
